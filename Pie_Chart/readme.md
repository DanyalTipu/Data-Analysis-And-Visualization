# Pie Chart Tasks

This project involves tasks related to creating and updating pie charts using Plotly Express and Graph Objects.

## Tasks Overview

### 1. How to Select a Plot?

Before creating a pie chart, it's essential to understand the type of data and the purpose of visualization. Pie charts are suitable for displaying proportions or percentages of a whole.

### 2. How to Transform Your Data to Include Plot?

To include data in a pie chart, you need to transform it into a format suitable for visualization. This involves loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and selecting the relevant columns for plotting.

#### a) Read Buildings Dataset into a Pandas Format

Load the buildings dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for further processing and visualization.

#### b) Display Data of Deaths of Birds with Respect to Buildings

Select and display data related to the deaths of birds concerning different buildings.

### 3. How to Update Graph Using Plotly Express?

Plotly Express provides easy-to-use functions for creating and updating plots interactively.

#### a) Make a Donut out of Pie Chart

Transform the pie chart into a donut chart for better visualization and aesthetics.

#### b) Change Color with Respect to Building Sides

Update the color scheme of the pie chart based on different sides of buildings.

### 4. How to Update Graph Using Graph Objects?

Graph Objects offer more control and customization options for creating and updating plots.

#### a) Update Color of Text Inside Graph

Customize the color of text elements inside the pie chart for better readability.

#### b) Mention Building Number and Percentage on Pie Chart Along with on Hover

Include building numbers and percentages on the pie chart slices and enable hovering functionality for additional information.

#### c) Disable Clickable Functionality of a Graph

Disable the clickable functionality of the pie chart to prevent unintended interactions.

## Code File

The tasks mentioned above can be implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. Ensure you have the required libraries, such as Plotly Express and Plotly Graph Objects, installed to run the code.

## Dependencies

To run the code, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Plotly Express
- Plotly Graph Objects
- Pandas

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install plotly pandas
