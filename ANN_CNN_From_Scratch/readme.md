# Implementing Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from Scratch

This project involves the implementation of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch. Below are the details of the implementation.

## Implemented Models

1. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**:
   - Implemented a feedforward neural network with multiple layers including input, hidden, and output layers.
   - Utilized activation functions such as ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) for hidden layers and softmax for the output layer.
   - Implemented backpropagation for training the neural network by adjusting the weights using gradient descent.

2. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**:
   - Implemented a basic CNN architecture with convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
   - Utilized activation functions such as ReLU for the convolutional layers and softmax for the output layer.
   - Implemented forward and backward propagation to train the CNN and update the weights.

## Code Implementation

The implementation of ANN and CNN can be found in the following code files:
- `ann_cnn.ipynb`

## Dependencies

To run the code, you'll need the following dependencies:

- NumPy: For numerical computations.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization.

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
