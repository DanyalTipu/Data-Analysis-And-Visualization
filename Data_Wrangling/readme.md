# Rossmann Store Sales Data Wrangling

## Project Overview

This project involves the analysis and preparation of data from the Rossmann Store Sales competition on Kaggle. The primary goal is to clean and preprocess the datasets (`Train.csv` and `Store.csv`) to make them suitable for further analysis and modeling.

## Datasets

- **Train.csv**: Contains historical sales data for Rossmann stores.
- **Store.csv**: Contains meta-information about the stores.

## Data Wrangling Steps

### 1. Import Libraries

We start by importing the necessary libraries for data manipulation and analysis.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
